# Crowd-Detection-Camera-to-Prevent-COVID-19
In this time when COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, it is essential to maintain social distance and avoid large public gatherings at one place to break the chain of corona infection.But maintaining this is not easy. Many people, knowingly or unknowingly, gather and roam on the streets. Keeping an eye on all these activities is not an easy job. The authorities need reliable technology that can survey such places to prevent any unnecessary movement. Our COVID-19 Crowd Detection Camera can help in isolating the poeple 

So, today we have decided to make a Smart COVID-19 Crowd Detection Camera that will keep a watchful eye on all illegal activities and detect any crowd/person/vehicle on the road. The device also can alert the authorities regarding unnecessary gatherings.

However, this camera is not just limited to this. It can be used to:</br>
--> Detect high traffic on roads.</br>
--> Identify any unauthorised human entry in a restricted area.</br>
--> Observe the number of people in a hall/auditorium.</br>
--> Maintain and monitor the flow of the crowd in a protest demonstration.</br>

Technologies used:</br>
The neural network was trained used using the YoloV3 Algorithm.</br>
COCO dataset was used to train the model.</br>
Scipy cdist method was used to calculate the distance.</br>
